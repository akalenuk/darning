darning
=======

GIMP script for cleaning pictures. It takes a background from a rectangular selection border and interpolates the selection contents based on this border.

It is slow and doesn't support undo, so use at your own risk. 

This script was built based on one of the features of my other project - the Unpager - https://github.com/akalenuk/unpager The Unpager can do darning not only for rectangular forms, but for any quadrilateral.
